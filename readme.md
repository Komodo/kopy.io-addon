This addon adds the ability to send code to kopy.io from Komodo.

kopy.io will be an integral part of Komodo 9 and beyond, this addon intends to
bring some of that functionality to Komodo 8 (might work on earlier versions by
modifying the install.rdf).

After installing and restarting you can share code by right clicking in the editor
and selecting "Share Code via kopy.io". If you have code selected only the selected
code will be submitted.

If you are using a base16 color schemes kopy.io will attempt to automatically
adopt the same color scheme.
